47,"When a meeting is recorded, all events are stored in Redis DB."
41,"When using a learning management system (LMS) such as Moodle, teachers can setup BigBlueButton rooms within their course and students can access the rooms and their recordings."
60,"We think FreeSWITCH is an amazing piece of software for handling audio."
9,"The HTML5 server is built upon Meteor.js in ECMA2015 for communication between client and server and upon MongoDB for keeping the state of each BigBlueButton client consistent with the BigBlueButton server."
27,"Backends handle all the non-streamer events."
52,"Below is a diagram of the different components of Apps Akka."
78,"Presentation conversion flow."
50,"BigBlueButton Apps is the main application that pulls together the different applications to provide real-time collaboration in the meeting."
38,"Every access to BigBlueButton comes through a front-end portal (we refer to as a third-party application)."
61,"FreeSWITCH provides the voice conferencing capability in BigBlueButton."
56,"We have extracted out the component that integrates with FreeSWITCH into itâ€™s own application."
42,"The BigBlueButton comes with some simple API demos."
1,"High-level architecture."
80,"We take in consideration the configuration for enabling and disabling SWF, SVG and PNG conversion."
25,"Frontends other DDP events including method calls to send events to akka-apps
Frontends handle completely the Streamer redis events: Cursor, Annotations, External video share."
65,"Kurento and WebRTC-SFU."
35,"BigBlueButton web application is a Java-based application written in Scala."
55,"FSESL akka."
64,"FreeSWITCH can also be integrated with VOIP providers so that users who are not able to join using the headset will be able to call in using their phone."
59,"FreeSWITCH."
53,"The meeting business logic is in the MeetingActor."
69,"Joining a voice conference."
24,"Frontends collection subscription and publishing."
68,"The WebRTC-SFU acts as the media controller handling negotiations and to manage the media streams."
32,"In this way, you can change configuration values of BigBlueButton, or use some of the helper functions in apply-lib.sh."
10,"The MongoDB database contains information about all meetings on the server and, in turn, each client connected to a meeting."
11,"Each user's client is only aware of the their meeting's state, such the user's public and private chat messages sent and received."
17,"This process would start to bottleneck (the nodejs process, running on a single CPU core, started to use 100% of the core)."
8,"The HTML5 server sits behind nginx."
2,"The following diagram provides a high-level view of how BigBlueButton's components work together."
76,"The PDF document is then converted into scalable vector graphics (SVG) via bbb-web."
54,"This is where information about the meeting is stored and where all messages for a meeting is processed."
26,"Frontends still require MeetingStarted and MeetingEnded events to create/destroy per-meeting event processing queues."
81,"Then below the SVG conversion flow."
13,"Updates to MongoDB on the server side are automatically pushed to MiniMongo on the client side."
46,"Redis DB."
70,"A user can join the voice conference (running in FreeSWITCH) from the BigBlueButton HTML5 client or through the phone."
19,"BigBlueButton 2.3 moves away from a single nodejs process for bbb-html5 towards multiple nodejs processes handling incoming messages from clients."
36,"It implements the BigBlueButton API and holds a copy of the meeting state."
22,"A restart of BigBlueButton is required if you make changes to these files."
28,"If more than one backend is running, bbb-web splits the load in round-robin fashion by assigning an instanceId."
5,"The HTML5 client is a single page, responsive web application that is built upon the following components:
React.js for rendering the user interface in an efficient manner, WebRTC for sending/receiving audio and video."
67,"KMS is responsible for streaming of webcams, listen-only audio, and screensharing."
79,"The diagram below describes the flow of the presentation conversion."
44,"Redis PubSub."
82,"It covers the conversion fallback."
29,"So individual backends only process redis events for the meetings matching the associated instanceId."
21,"As of 2.3-alpha-7, bbb-html5 uses 2 ""frontend"" and two ""backend"" processes (this value is configurable in bbb-html5-with-roles.conf, see Configuration Files)."
77,"The conversion process sends progress messages to the client through the Redis pubsub."
72,"WebRTC provides the user with high-quality audio with lower delay."
20,"This means that bbb-html5 could use multiple CPU cores for processing messages and handling browser sessions (each nodejs process runs on a single CPU core)."
43,"Regardless of which front-end you use, they all use the API under the hood."
12,"The client side subscribes to the published collections on the server side."
75,"When the uploaded presentation is an Office document, it needs to be converted into PDF using LibreOffice."
31,"When you use sudo bbb-conf --setip <hostname> or sudo bbb-conf --restart, bbb-conf will run /etc/bigbluebutton/bbb-conf/apply-config.sh between shutdown and restart of the BigBlueButton processes."
51,"It provides the list of users, chat, whiteboard, presentations in a meeting."
73,"Uploading a presentation."
39,"BigBlueButton integrates Moodle, Wordpress, Canvas, Sakai, and others (see third-party integrations)."
71,"When joining through the client, the user can choose to join Microphone or Listen Only, and the BigBlueButton client will make an audio connection to the server via WebRTC."
3,"We'll break down each component in more detail below."
15,"Scalability of HTML5 server component."
14,"The following diagram gives an overview of the architecture of the HTML5 client and its communications with the other components in BigBlueButton."
40,"BigBlueButton comes with its own front-end called Greenlight."
37,"The BigBlueButton API provides a third-party integration (such as the BigBlueButtonBN plugin for Moodle) with an endpoint to control the BigBlueButton server."
45,"Redis PubSub provides a communication channel between different applications running on the BigBlueButton server."
30,"ValidateAuthTokenResp is passed to backends as well, which is needed for the cases where you only have a backend, no frontends - for example dev environments that do not need to care about scaling."
18,"Because nodejs was running on a single CPU core, having a 16 or 32 CPU core server for BigBlueButton 2.2 failed to yield much additional scalability."
62,"Users are able to join the voice conference through the headset."
57,"This allows others who are using voice conference systems other than FreeSWITCH to easily create their own integration."
83,"Sometimes we detect that the generated SVG file is heavy to load by the browser, we use the fallback to put a rasterized image inside the SVG file and make its loading light for the browser."
6,"The HTML5 client connects directly with the BigBlueButton server over port 443 (SSL), from loading the BigBlueButton client to making a web socket connection."
58,"Communication between apps and FreeSWITCH Event Socket Layer (fsels) uses messages through redis pubsub."
16,"BigBlueButton 2.2 used a single nodejs process for all client-side communication."
84,"Internal network connections."
63,"Users joining through Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox are able to take advantage of higher quality audio by connecting using WebRTC."
49,"Apps akka."
23,"The breakdown of functionality between front-end and back-end is as follows:
Frontends receive the ValidateAuthTokenResp event to complete authentication."
66,"Kurento Media Server KMS is a media server that implements both SFU and MCU models."
34,"BBB web."
74,"Uploaded presentations go through a conversion process in order to be displayed inside the client."
48,"When the meeting ends, the Recording Processor will take all the recorded events as well as the different raw (PDF, WAV, FLV) files for processing."
85,"The following diagram shows how the various components of BigBlueButton connect to each other via sockets."
4,"HTML5 client."
7,"These connections are all handled by nginx."
33,"See ""Automatically apply configuration changes on restart""."
