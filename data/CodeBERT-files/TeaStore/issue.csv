41,"Every running instance of the TeaStore uses one single registry."
9,"The status view lists the instance count and hosts for all registered service instances."
27,"The Recommender is used to generate individual product recommendations for each user."
38,"Service instances register themselves at the registry on startup."
42,"The TeaStore is a test application."
1,"The TeaStore consists of 5 replicatable services and a single Registry instance."
25,"The persistence provider uses a second level entity cache provided by the JPA implementation."
35,"Furthermore, one order-based nearest-neighbor approach is available."
24,"It features endpoints for general CRUD-Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for the persistent entities."
32,"If the user is known, Slope One as item-based collaborative filtering is applied to calculate the recommendations."
10,"The Image Provider delivers images to the WebUI as base64 encoded strings to embed them in the final HTML."
11,"It matches the provided product ID or UI name (the filename for images not representing a product and therefore without product ID) and the image size to a unique image identifier."
17,"Before loading an image from the physical drive, a cache lookup will be performed and if the image is present, delivered directly from cache or from the physical drive otherwise."
8,"The UI provides a status page at link indicating the current state of the TeaStore."
2,"The WebUI service retrieves images from the Image Provider."
26,"As such, it also acts as a caching layer."
13,"If the product ID or UI name is found but not in the requested size, the largest image will be loaded and scaled."
19,"Passwords are hashed using BCrypt."
36,"Its recommendation time is dependent on the number of items in the current cart as well as the total number of stored orders."
22,"The Persistence service provides access to the data persisted in the relational database back-end."
28,"It is trained using all existing orders."
5,"The WebUI provides the TeaStore front-end using Servlets in combination with JSP files."
29,"Recommendations are generated based on the users current shopping cart, the user's previous orders and/or the item the user is currently looking at."
21,"When a SessionBlob is received, the cookie content is re-salted and checked against the hash to check for session tampering."
20,"To validate sessions, the SessionBlob is salted and hashed using SHA512 and stored in a cookie."
43,"By limiting it to a single registry instance, it enables easy configuration of multiple parallel TeaStores with minimal configuration overhead."
12,"If the product ID or UI name is not available to the Image Provider, a standard ""not found"" image will be delivered in the correct size."
31,"If the current user is unknown (e.g., if the user is not logged in or did not purchase anything yet), a fallback algorithm based on the general item popularity is chosen."
39,"Services are also required to send a heartbeat signal by re-registering periodically."
3,"Users are authenticated by the Auth service."
15,"If the product ID or UI name and size is found, the image will be loaded and delivered."
14,"The scaled image is stored for later use."
40,"Services missing their heartbeat for more than 10 s are assumed to be offline until the register function is called again."
37,"The Registry provides information about how many service instances are online for each service and where they are located."
30,"The item rating of the users are based on their purchases."
18,"The Auth service handles user and session authentication."
6,"It contains logic to save and retireve values from cookies."
16,"To speed up image delivery, an in-memory cache with Least Frequently Used (LFU) replacemenent strategy is in place."
23,"It maps the relational entities to the JSON entity objects passed between services using the EclipseLink JPA ORM mapper."
34,"One CPU-intensive, calculating the item-rankings per user on-the-go and one memory-intensive, calculating the total user rating prediction matrix during the training phase."
4,"Data is retrieved from the PersistenceProvider and product recommendations from the Recommender service."
7,"Images (with few exceptions) are not provides by the WebUi, but are retrieved from the Image Provider service instead."
33,"We implemented two versions of the algorithm."
