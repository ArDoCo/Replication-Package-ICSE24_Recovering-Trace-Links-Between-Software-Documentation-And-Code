FTLR expects the datasets in this folder with the following folder structure:

- `ProjectName`
    - `code`
    - `docs`

Where `docs` includes the textual source artifacts (sentences) as single files and `code` comprises the code files.

[Dataset.py](/.Dataset.py) already includes predefined Datasets classes for MediaStore, Teammates, TeaStore, BigBlueButton and JabRef.

Results are printed into an output folder next to the `docs` and `code` folders.
