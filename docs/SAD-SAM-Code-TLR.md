# Traceability Link Recovery between Software Architecture Documentations (SADs) and Code via Software Architecture Models (SAMs)

To recover trace links between SADs and code, we combine the traceability link recovery between [SAD-SAM](SAD-SAM-TLR.md) and [SAM-Code](SAM-Code-TLR.md).
Both approaches are executed and their resulting trace links combined via `TransitiveTraceLinks` that match the parts of the documentation to the parts of code
using the model.
